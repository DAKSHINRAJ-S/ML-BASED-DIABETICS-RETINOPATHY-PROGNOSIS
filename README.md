The prognosis of diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes affecting the eyes, varies based on several factors. Early detection through regular eye examinations and timely treatment significantly improves the outlook. However, if left untreated or poorly managed, the disease can progress, potentially leading to severe vision loss or blindness. Complications like macular edema and retinal detachment further impact prognosis. Individual factors such as diabetes duration, blood sugar control, and overall health also play a role. Adherence to treatment and management recommendations, coupled with ongoing monitoring by healthcare professionals, are essential for preserving vision and improving long-term outcomes.
